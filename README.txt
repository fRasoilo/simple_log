SimpleLog is a simple to use logging utility written in C++.

It is a single file header that implements logging utility functions (to a file or a console)
that should be very easy to drop-in and start using in any pre-existing project.

For a quick start check the top of simple_log.h in the section called "Basic Usage / Quick Start"/
